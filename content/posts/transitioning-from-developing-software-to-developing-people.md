## Note
* Success becomes fuzzier
    * I made a cool thing → I enabled my team to make a cool thing
* **Busy is not the same as productive**
    * Develop a task management system (e.g., GTD)
* Meetings
    * should have a goal
    * should have action items
    * can end early
    * small meetings are for decisions
    * large meetings are for brainstorming/broadcasting
* Politics
    * Relationships are critical for doing anything
    * Looking for collaborative solutions
* Process
    * Find projects that the business values and fit/expand your team’s skill set
    * Keep your team interested and working at a sustainable pace
    * Work with your team to estimate tasks and measure capacity
        * People Over Process
