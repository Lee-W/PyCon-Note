## Note
* SQLAlchemy
    * SQL Expression Language (a Python DSL)
    * Object Relational Mapper (ORM)

* The ORM Trap
    * Sensible Python Code â†’ Bad SQL access patterns
    * unnoticeable at low data volumes
        * e.g., dev and early production

* The Fix: Let the DB do its job
    * Be aware of implicit queries
        * especially from relationships
    * Aim for O(1) queries per request/job/activity
        * Avoid looping through model instances
