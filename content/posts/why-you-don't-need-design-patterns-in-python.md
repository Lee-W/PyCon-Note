## Note
As the speaker stated in youtube comments, **"Why you don't need SOME design patterns in Python?"** could be a better title for this talk.

* Singleton Pattern
    * using a module may be a better solution
* Facade Pattern
    * Helpful to organize code, no need for a class
* Command Pattern (object oriented callback)
    * just use plain function
* Visitor Pattern
    * `getattr` or `from functools import singledispatch`
* Decorator Pattern
    * Decorator pattern is not `@decorator`
    * `def __getattr__(self)`
