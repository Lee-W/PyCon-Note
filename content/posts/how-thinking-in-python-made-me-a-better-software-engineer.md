## Note
* **Task Switching reduce your productivity time**
* Immediate Feedback
    * Catching bugs earlier reduces task switching
    * Learn faster
    * Confidence that your code works
* Standard Representation & API
* Composability
    * Type hint
        * Do we really want to define types and structures before understanding problems?
* Prototyping
    * You write it once, gaining experience in both, understanding the problem, and understanding a solution.
    * You write it again, with less things to worry about and attention to finer details.
