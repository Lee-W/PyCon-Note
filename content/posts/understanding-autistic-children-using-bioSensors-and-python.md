## Note
* Emotion Recognition
    * How others do?
        * Facial
        * Speech
    * Both does not work for autism
        * Facial: Difficulty in expressing
        * Speech: Cannot be control
* Why not physiological signal → AutiGlove
    * BioSensors → Capture Signal
        * Galvanic Skin Response
        * Pulse Sensor
* Experiment
    * Play Emotional Video
* [BioSPPy](https://biosppy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): BioSingal Processing in Python
* Q & A
    * How many people work on it?
        * Team of 2 computer science students
