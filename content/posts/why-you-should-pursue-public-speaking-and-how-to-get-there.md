## Note

### Why?
* **Present** better in front of the company
* Being a software engineer is much more than coding, its about good **communication**
* Getting better at **crucial conversation**
* Great trick for **introverts** to meet people

### Overcoming our fear
1. nervous
    * find your **harbor**
2. forget something to say
    * practice your **comeback** if you forget what to say
    * rehearse potential problem (e.g., projector not working)
    * blank out on stage
        * "Let's skip this for now"
        * **Drink water**
3. being exposed as a fraud
    * the art of saying "I don't know"
4. not being good enough
    * imposter syndrome
    * But, how good is good enough?
        * Attend conference talks. You need reference.

### How to get better?
* **The Lean Startup model**
    * Build
    * Measure
    * Learn
    * Repeat

* Building the proposal and the talk
    * Pick topics you're truly **interested** in
    * Check the **call for proposal** from first
        * also show how you can **modify your talk for a short slot**
    * **Who, what and how**
    * tell about your own **experience**
    * **apply again**
* Measure / Learn
    * Gather feedback from audience
    * Watch your presentation
    * Take notes on what questions are being asked. They're what people interested in.
* Repeat
    * reuse your talk in different occasions
