## Note

### Are Python types Pythonic?

```python
import this

>>> Explicit is better than implicit.

>>> Readability counts

>>> In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
```

If nothing else, because Guido said so ðŸ˜†

### Type 101
* Collection, Union, Optional, Type

```python
from typing import Type, TypeVar

class BaseClass:
    pass

class DerivedClass(BaseClass):
    pass

T = TypeVar("T", bound=BaseClass)

def factory(clazz: Type[T]) -> T:
    return claszz()
```
